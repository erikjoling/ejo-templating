Ejo Templating
===

The time that themes are in full control over the websites markup and code is over. We are entering an age of components. And the HTML of these components will be generated by plugins, core and users through the editor. 

The theme will be responsible for configuring the components, laying them out and styling them, as well as the whole website.

That's why we need to offer components which the themes could use. This foundation can play this part.
